Predicting Airfare on New Routes

- Developed predictive models to estimate airfare on new routes using real-world data sourced from Kaggle, addressing congestion challenges caused by airline deregulation in the 1990s.
- Performed data preprocessing, including sampling, handling missing values, and partitioning datasets, to prepare data for analysis.
- Built and evaluated machine learning models such as logistic regression, k-NN, neural networks, linear regression, and k-means clustering using Analytic Solver, measuring performance with RMSE and MAD metrics.
- Implemented the same models using SAP Cloud Analytics and R programming, comparing results across platforms to identify the most accurate predictions.
- Delivered actionable insights and recommendations for aviation consulting strategies by analyzing model outputs and predictive accuracy.
